# Step 2: Gap Analysis & ATS Scoring

I’ll analyze your CV against the job description to determine **ATS compatibility** and suggest improvements.

### **Breakdown**
✅ **Step 1: Calculate Matching Score (0-100%)**
- Compare skills, experience, and qualifications between my CV and the job description.
- Assign a **Matching Score (%)** based on overlap.
- Indicate whether gaps are **critical (high impact)** or **minor (low impact)**.

✅ **Step 2: Strengths & Gaps Analysis**
- ✅ **Strengths:** List matched skills, experiences, and keywords.
- ⚠️ **Gaps:** Identify missing terms, weak phrasing, or skill mismatches.
- 🔍 **ATS Optimization:** Detect missing keywords that could impact **ATS filtering**.

### **Suggested Table Format**
| **Category**        | **Matched Items**          | **Missing Items**          |
|---------------------|--------------------------|----------------------------|
| **Technical Skills** | ✅ Python, Data Analysis | ❌ Cloud Computing, SQL    |
| **Soft Skills**      | ✅ Leadership, Teamwork  | ❌ Strategic Thinking      |
| **Experience**      | ✅ Project Management    | ❌ No mention of Agile     |

💡 **Would you like me to prioritize certain improvements first?**
🚀 *I can suggest natural ways to integrate missing keywords without keyword stuffing.*
